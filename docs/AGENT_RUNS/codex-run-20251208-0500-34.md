**Structure Updated**
- Replaced `README.md:1` with the minimalist nova-process overview that now matches the requested stub.
- Added the human-facing suite, including orientation, dictionary, examples, and philosophy stubs (`human/README.md:1`, `human/examples/phases-and-checkpoints.md:1`, `human/philosophy/co-development-model.md:1`).
- Added Nova-facing materials such as the process manual, templates, surveys, and contingency guides (`nova/process-manual.md:1`, `nova/templates/unified-abc-agent-template.md:1`, `nova/surveys/human-mini.md:1`, `nova/lifebuoy.md:1`, `nova/flare-gun.md:1`, `nova/towel.md:1`).
- Added the agent specification suite to document mechanical responsibilities and constraints (`agent/AGENT.md:1`).
- Verified presence of every file using `find human nova agent -type f -print`; no automated lint or format tools were run.

Next steps: flesh out each stub with the full documentation, templates, and guidance that the process requires.
