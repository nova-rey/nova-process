## What This Is

Nova-Process is a way of working with AI systems that treats **thinking, execution, and coordination as different jobs** — and assigns each job to the entity best suited to do it.

It is not a framework you must obey.
It is not a productivity system.
It is not a set of tricks for “prompt engineering.”

It is a **division of responsibility** designed to keep humans sane, agents reliable, and projects coherent over time.

---

## The Three Roles

Nova-Process is built around three distinct roles:

### 1. Humans

Humans are responsible for:

- creativity
- intent
- values
- judgment
- deciding *what matters*

Humans provide:
- ideas
- goals
- constraints
- priorities
- context

Humans are **not** responsible for:
- mechanical execution
- remembering every rule
- enforcing consistency across dozens of files
- catching every edge case

If you are tired, distracted, emotional, or unsure — that is normal.  
This system is designed with that assumption.

---

### 2. Codex (Agents)

Codex refers to execution-oriented AI agents.

Codex is responsible for:

- mechanical work
- repetition
- enforcement of rules
- applying changes exactly as instructed
- running tests, formatting, and verification

Codex is **not** responsible for:
- interpreting intent
- deciding scope
- resolving ambiguity
- inventing requirements
- “doing what seems best”

Codex is powerful, fast, and literal.  
It must be constrained to be safe and useful.

---

### 3. Nova

Nova is the connective layer between humans and agents.

Nova is responsible for:

- coherence
- pacing
- mediation
- asking when things don’t line up
- stopping work when assumptions are unsafe
- helping humans think clearly
- helping agents act correctly

Nova understands both:
- human language and ambiguity
- agent rules and constraints

Nova does **not** replace human judgment  
and does **not** perform mechanical execution.

Nova exists so that:
- humans don’t have to become machines
- machines don’t have to pretend to be human

---

## Division of Power

This system intentionally separates power.

- Humans decide **what** should happen.
- Codex decides **how** to execute it mechanically.
- Nova decides **whether it is safe, clear, and coherent to proceed**.

No single role is allowed to do all three.

This separation is what prevents:
- burnout
- runaway scope
- silent failure
- “MP hell”
- agents confidently doing the wrong thing

---

## Atomic Work

All work in Nova-Process is performed as **atomic tasks**.

An atomic task:

- has one clear objective
- runs without interruption once started
- either completes fully or fails clearly
- does not pause to ask for confirmation mid-run

This protects humans from having to babysit execution  
and protects projects from half-finished changes.

---

## Two Kinds of Work

There are two supported kinds of atomic work:

### Checkpoints (A/B/C)

Used for:
- features
- refactors
- multi-step changes
- anything where assumptions must be checked before acting

Checkpoints explicitly separate:
- thinking
- doing
- verifying

They are deliberate by design.

---

### Mini-Pushes (MP)

Used for:
- small changes
- documentation updates
- tests
- cleanup
- exposure of existing functionality

Mini-Pushes are intentionally constrained.
If something cannot be done safely as an MP, it should not be forced.

---

## What This Manual Is (and Is Not)

This document:

- explains the *shape* of the system
- defines responsibilities and boundaries
- helps humans orient themselves
- sets expectations

This document does **not**:

- teach prompting
- include agent instructions
- contain execution rules
- describe file-level mechanics

Those live elsewhere, by design.

---

## A Note on Trust

Nova-Process assumes:

- humans are allowed to be human
- machines must be constrained
- coordination is a real job
- stopping is sometimes the correct action

If something feels confusing, overwhelming, or brittle,  
that is a signal — not a failure.

The system is meant to support thinking, not replace it.

---

## Closing

Nova-Process is not about speed.
It is about **clarity, safety, and continuity**.

You are not expected to master it.
You are expected to use it as a scaffold.

Everything else grows from there.
