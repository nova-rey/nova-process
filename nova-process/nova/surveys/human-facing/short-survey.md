# Short Exit Survey (Human)
Version: v0.1.0

This is a quick, optional check-in after a task or thread ends.

You are not required to answer.
Skipping is always OK.

## Question 1 (choose one)

How did this run feel overall?

- ✅ Win — did what I needed
- 😐 Meh — worked, but frictiony
- ❌ Mess — frustrating or blocked

---

## Optional Question 2 (one sentence max)

What is the *one* thing that would have made this better?

(Examples: clearer brief, fewer surprises, better tests, less scope creep)

End of survey
