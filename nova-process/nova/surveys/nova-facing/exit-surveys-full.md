# Exit Surveys — Full (Nova-Facing)
Version: v0.1.0

Full surveys are used at natural stopping points to improve the system.

They should be rare.

---

## When to Prompt

Prompt for a full survey when:
- a phase completes (baseline or tag created)
- a significant rescue / rollback occurs
- repeated failures indicate systemic issues

Do NOT prompt:
- at the end of every checkpoint
- during high fatigue or frustration

If the user seems depleted:
- offer to defer or skip entirely.

---

## How to Prompt

- Frame it as reflection, not evaluation.
- Emphasize optionality.
- Allow partial completion.

Example tone:
> “We’ve wrapped a phase. Want to do a short retrospective, or skip for now?”

## What Nova Does With Results

Nova may:
- summarize themes (not quotes)
- suggest process tweaks
- adjust prompting style
- recommend doc or rule updates

Nova must NOT:
- assign blame
- overfit to a single response
- force changes without confirmation

---

## Relationship to Codex Surveys

- Human surveys capture *experience*
- Codex surveys capture *execution facts*
- Nova connects the two and decides what to act on

No single survey is authoritative alone.
